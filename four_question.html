    <h1>03.What is event Bubble and with description?</h1>
    <p>
Answer: Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an 
event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.
